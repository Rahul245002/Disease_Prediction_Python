Machine Learning Models for Health Diagnostics

Problem Statement

The rising prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease necessitates efficient early diagnostic tools. This repository aims to develop predictive machine learning models that can assist healthcare providers in identifying at-risk individuals early and taking preventive measures.

Objectives

Diabetes Prediction

Develop a robust machine learning model to predict diabetes based on patient health metrics.
Provide insights into key features that significantly impact diabetes risk.
Heart Disease Prediction

Build a classification model to assess the likelihood of heart disease using patient data.
Identify patterns and relationships between health indicators and heart disease.
General Goals

Improve model accuracy and reliability.
Enhance understanding of the datasets through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Provide actionable insights to healthcare stakeholders.

Dataset Overview

Diabetes Dataset

Features: Includes attributes like glucose level, BMI, age, insulin, and other diagnostic metrics.
Target: Binary classification (1 = Diabetes, 0 = No Diabetes).
Source: Publicly available health dataset (e.g., Pima Indians Diabetes Database).
Heart Disease Dataset

Features: Comprises data on age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate achieved, and more.
Target: Binary classification (1 = Heart Disease, 0 = No Heart Disease).
Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset or similar health-related data sources.
Data Characteristics

Cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Balanced datasets (where applicable) to ensure fair model training.

Skills Showcased

Data Analysis
